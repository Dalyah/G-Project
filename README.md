# G-Project
This project is part of a tutorial prepared for deepgaze CNN head pose estimator model.

Under HPE, you will find visualize_results.py file in which I used different functions and models from deepgaze library[1]
to estimate the head pose and visualize the outcome on different images from AFLW dataset [2].
You will also find how to prepare Prima_dataset[3] for trining and testing using ex_prima_parser.py from deepgaze library.

# Installation 
To be able to run the project on your machine, you must install:
1.  Python 2.7 
2.	Pip
3.	Numpy
4.	OpenCV 2.0
5.	TensorFlow
